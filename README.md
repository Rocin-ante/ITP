Title of the project

Online Marketplace

Problem description

Lacking the resources and expertise to build and manage their own e-commerce sites, 
many sellers struggle to compete with large retailers online. As a result, they miss out on 
potential customers who prefer to shop online.

Solution description

Our solution is to create an online marketplace that will enable sellers to sell their products 
and services online. The platform would provide an easy-to-use interface to build and 
manage their merchandise, while also providing a convenient and user-friendly shopping 
experience for customers.

Technical environment

We will use HTML , Bootstrap, php, JavaScript, mySQL, css, to develop the platform.
MeisterTask is used as a project management tool.

Other remarks

The platform will also include features such as customer reviews and ratings, social sharing 
and personalized recommendations to enhance the user experience.
